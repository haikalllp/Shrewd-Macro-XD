## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation and Structure

#### Step 1: Backup the Current Project
- [x] Create a full backup of the project directory
- [x] Set up version control (Git) if not already in place
- [x] Create an initial commit with the current state

```powershell
# PowerShell script to create backup
$sourceDir = "E:\CODING\Projects\CODE\Macro"
$backupDir = "E:\CODING\Projects\CODE\Macro_Backup_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')"
Copy-Item -Path $sourceDir -Destination $backupDir -Recurse
```

#### Step 2: Organize Directory Structure
- [ ] Create the following directory structure:
  ```
  MouseMacro/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── UI/
  │   ├── Configuration/
  │   ├── Hooks/
  │   ├── Utilities/
  │   ├── Models/
  ├── tests/
  ├── docs/
  ```
- [x] Move existing files to their appropriate locations
- [x] Update namespace declarations in all files
- [x] Update project file (MouseMacro.csproj) to reflect new structure

```powershell
# PowerShell script to create directory structure
$projectDir = "E:\CODING\Projects\CODE\Macro"
$directories = @(
    "src\UI\Controls",
    "src\Configuration",
    "src\Hooks",
    "src\Utilities",
    "src\Models",
    "tests",
    "docs"
)

foreach ($dir in $directories) {
    $path = Join-Path -Path $projectDir -ChildPath $dir
    if (-not (Test-Path $path)) {
        New-Item -Path $path -ItemType Directory
        Write-Host "Created directory: $path"
    }
}
```

```powershell
# PowerShell script to move files
$projectDir = "E:\CODING\Projects\CODE\Macro"

# Define file moves (source -> destination)
$fileMoves = @{
    "MacroForm.cs" = "src\UI\MacroForm.cs"
    "MacroForm.Designer.cs" = "src\UI\MacroForm.Designer.cs"
    "ModernButton.cs" = "src\UI\Controls\ModernButton.cs"
    "ModernTrackBar.cs" = "src\UI\Controls\ModernTrackBar.cs"
    "NativeMethods.cs" = "src\Hooks\NativeMethods.cs"
    "Program.cs" = "src\Program.cs"
    # Add other files as needed
}

foreach ($file in $fileMoves.Keys) {
    $sourcePath = Join-Path -Path $projectDir -ChildPath $file
    $destPath = Join-Path -Path $projectDir -ChildPath $fileMoves[$file]
    
    if (Test-Path $sourcePath) {
        # Create destination directory if it doesn't exist
        $destDir = Split-Path -Path $destPath -Parent
        if (-not (Test-Path $destDir)) {
            New-Item -Path $destDir -ItemType Directory
        }
        
        # Move the file
        Move-Item -Path $sourcePath -Destination $destPath -Force
        Write-Host "Moved: $file -> $($fileMoves[$file])"
