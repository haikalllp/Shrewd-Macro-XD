# Detailed Progress Tracking Plan: Fixing the Settings Configuration Issue

## Overview
Our application currently loads default settings at launch instead of using the saved configuration from the JSON file. Although the JSON file is located in the same directory as the executable (using `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory`), the deserialization process is not updating the settings because the properties in the `AppSettings` class are read-only.

## Affected Files
- **src/Models/AppSettings.cs**  
  - Contains read-only properties for `MacroSettings`, `UISettings`, and `HotkeySettings`.  
  - **Issue:** These properties prevent JSON deserialization from overwriting the default values.

- **src/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs**  
  - Handles loading and saving the configuration from the JSON file in the executable's directory.  
  - **Note:** The logic here is correct, but it relies on proper deserialization of `AppSettings`.

## Proposed Solutions
There are two approaches to allow JSON deserialization to update the settings:

1. **Add Public Setters**  
   Modify the properties in `AppSettings.cs` to include public setters so they can be updated during deserialization.  
   **Example:**
   ```csharp
   // Before:
   public MacroSettings MacroSettings => _macroSettings;
   
   // After:
   public MacroSettings MacroSettings { get; set; } = new MacroSettings();
   ```

2. **Use the [JsonInclude] Attribute**  
   Keep the read-only pattern and decorate each property with `[JsonInclude]` so the deserializer will populate them.  
   **Example:**
   ```csharp
   using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
   
   // Before:
   public MacroSettings MacroSettings => _macroSettings;
   
   // After:
   [JsonInclude]
   public MacroSettings MacroSettings { get; } = new MacroSettings();
   ```

## Detailed Steps and Progress Tracking

- [ ] **Review Settings Loading:**  
  Verify that the JSON configuration file is correctly loaded from the executable's directory by reviewing the `AppDirectory` and `SettingsFilePath` definitions in `ConfigurationManager.cs`.

- [x] **Inspect AppSettings Class:**  
  Confirm that the properties for `MacroSettings`, `UISettings`, and `HotkeySettings` are currently read-only in `src/Models/AppSettings.cs`.

- [x] **Choose the Preferred Approach:**  
  Decide whether to add public setters or to use the `[JsonInclude]` attribute in `AppSettings.cs`.

- [x] **Implement Changes in AppSettings.cs:**  
  - **Option A (Public Setters):** Modify the properties to include public setters.
  - **Option B ([JsonInclude] Attribute):** Add the `[JsonInclude]` attribute to each property and ensure `using System.Text.Json.Serialization;` is included.

- [x] **Rebuild and Test the Application:**  
  Compile and run the application to confirm that settings loaded from the JSON file override the default settings.

- [ ] **Verify Persistence Functionality:**  
  Change some settings via the UI, save them, restart the application, and verify that the user settings persist.

- [x] **Document the Changes:**  
  Update documentation and inline comments to reflect the new configuration loading mechanism.

## Additional Considerations
- **Backup & Validation:**  
  Ensure that the backup and settings validation routines in `ConfigurationManager.cs` continue to work correctly after making changes.
  
- **Unit Testing:**  
  Consider writing unit tests for the settings loading and saving process to prevent regression in future updates.

- **Peer Code Review:**  
  Have the changes reviewed by a peer to ensure all edge cases are covered.

## Conclusion
By implementing one of the proposed solutions in `src/Models/AppSettings.cs`, the JSON deserialization process will correctly update the user settings. Follow the steps above to track progress, test thoroughly, and update the documentation for future maintenance.
